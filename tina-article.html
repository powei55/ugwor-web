            <p class="article-body more-info-text">He was married with his first wife for a very long time with only one daugher,
                there after got married to my mother in her late sixteen and gave birth to my senior brother, 
                myself and my younger sister. Due to our been born in his old age we could not enjoy our dad 
                since he could not properly take care of us, we could not have a proper education not because we
                were unruly or because of unwillinglyness but lacked proper resources for our education, matters 
                got worse when all his savings was lost as a result of obnoxious decree against former biafra.
                 At this stage my senior brother was taken to lagos by my uncle <strong> emmanuel Effiye</strong> 
                 who later died after a brief illness after which my father also died thus without any preparation
                  for life we were left to fend for ourselves.

                My mother <strong>mrs elizabeth efi</strong> got married to my step father who after a breif stay with
                him sent me away, i was pratically homeless and hopeless amidst all these woes i was determined never
                to have these experiences of divorced home repeat in my life as a married person, all these experiences 
                moulded my determination never to be divorced and to give my childer my best in life through education
                and any other kind of training that will prepare them for a fruitful and purposeful life. I had always
                prayed that i should not have a girl child, not because i don't love girls but because of my
                accumulated fears that they will recieve similar experience like i had while growing up.
                In african culture girls without parental protection are always exposed to sexual molestation
                which easily drives them to negative lifestyles like prostitution for surviavl. My hatred to
                protitution is deeply rooted through some of my friends in similar circumstances who fell for it.
                I nevertheless fell victim to some men who pretended to love me but in truth were only interested in exploiting me for thier gratification not wanting to bear my responsibilties.

                "YES" but we have not seen each for a very long time, he then make a desire
                to marry me. My husband sees me  as a lily in the mire who need to be cleanedup
                and given fresh life. According to him he was captivated by the simplicity,honesty,
                beauty and eloquence in english without formal education. He demanded to see my 
                 father and immediately we went to see him, he was wll recieved by my family who
                consented to him marrying me, however my mother refused initially to consent to 
                the marriage for reason of tribal difference, he was igbo from Enugu state, I ignored
                 my mothers objection since i had obtained my father's consent.
