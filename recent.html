                <p class="article-body">Enugu State (Igbo: È®ra Enugu) is a state in the South-East geopolitical zone
                     of Nigeria, bordered to the north by the states of Benue and Kogi, Ebonyi State to the east and
                      southeast, Abia State to the south, and Anambra State to the west. The state takes its name from 
                      its capital and largest city, Enugu. 
                    <p>
                        The name of the state derives from its capital city, Enugu. The word "Enugu" (from Enu Ugwu) means
                         "the top of the hill". The first European settlers arrived in the area in 1909, led by a British
                        mining engineer named Albert Kitson. In his quest for silver, he discovered coal in the Udi Ridge
                           which is why the state is regarded as coal city state.
