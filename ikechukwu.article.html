                    <h2 class="article-heading">how i escaped death in june 2018</h2>
                    After i completed my one year compulsory IT, i stayed for another year as earlier stated to gain experience because
                    as of the time i had worked with many experienced engineers in my feild with the like of <strong>mr James oyagbra</strong>,
                    <strong>engr jeff</strong>, <strong>engr olumide</strong> and many more, because of my decipline and resilence to learn i was handed a bigger
                    role as to be an instrutor in the company new project to renovate an existing struture. 

                    <p>july 11 2018 i had workers working, breaking of irrelevant strutures i.e walls, i was called by one of the workers
                        to check weather is to go ahead to fall down a particular wall, so i walked straight to the place gave the instruction
                        as to how that place will look like, was about coming out of the building and a concreate lintel(beam) collaspe and landed on
                        my right leg and arm, full of pains, groaning, it was like a dream, all of this happend in less than 5mins, i was immediately
                        rush to a Orthopaedic hospital where i was operated thus placing some kind of metal to supports my broken bones. The pains i pass through
                         over a month in the hospital without touching the ground is something i wound not wish for anybody, Thank GOD for my family,
                          the church, family friends and J-marvis Company for thier prayers and supports</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    i specially want to thank my mum <strong>mrs Tina mathias</strong>, i was suprised to see my mum the next day, she travelled
                    all the way from niger to benin and she was there till i was discharge, she was litrally there for me at all times, she was
                    my backbone. Seeing her sleeping on the bench for one full month in a hospital,i came to a conclusion that mothers(women) are 
                    the best gift God gave to us on earth. i will not bored with so many struggles i had to encounter during that period, i just want
                    to say JESUS gave me victory.
                </p>
                <p>Thank you mumsi, i am gratefull and i will forever love you.</p>
