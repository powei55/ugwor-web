                Having lost my father earlier in 1977 my mother singlehandedely struggled through 
                my secondary school career to sponsor my education. Faced with an aged mother
                i was reluctant to encumber her with further burden of sponsoring my education 
                so i decided to travel to Bida in Niger state to meet my maternal uncle and explore
                means of fending for myself and furthering my education. While at bida i worked 
                as a domestic help to the principal medical officer of then general hospital.
                Inwarldly i knew this was below my abilities but i accepted it as a means of
                saving money and going to the university to study either law or mass communication.
                It was my pursuit of this comsuming desire that i sat for GCE Advance  Level which i
                pass with credit. As fate would have it , it soon dawned on me that this certificate
                alone without somebody to foot education bill cannot get me the much desired higher
                education. it was while working with a foreign company that i met and married my loving
                and beautiful wife, <strong>tina Ebiakpobomere</strong> who happend to be working in the
                same company. Amiable and optimistic we had similar stories of dissappointment and unfufilled
                dreams to tell each other and that created a bonding effect and steel determination
                in our approach to life challenges. i had an edge against her academically but she 
                was more spritual and scriptural exposed. There has always been this mutual desire 
                in us to impact one another with our percuiliar advantage. This paid off handsomely
                in 1990 when the lord visited us with his salvation and our spritual lives and general
                literacy has improved steadily thereafter.  
            </p>

            <p class="article-body more-info-text">
                The lord blessed our marriage with four sons for which we are truly grateful but the rigorous
                task of child training and education with meager income as ours was overwhelming to put it mildly.
                We relocated to kaduna in 1992, did odd jobs and relocated back to bida in the year 2000 in a determined
                bid to save our marriage and give our children the best. It is pertinent to observe at this juncture
                that many people did not give our marriage the least chance of succes but for us no project
                that deserve better attention than the succes of our marriage
